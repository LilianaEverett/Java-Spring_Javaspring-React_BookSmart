## Restaurant Booking System:

#### User: Front of House Manager - Books tables on behalf of customers

We have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

### MVP:

The system must be able to:

* Allow a customer to book a table at the restaurant for a particular time and date
* Update a booking, for example if the customer wants to change a booking time
* Display a list of bookings for a given date
* Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visits

## How to run BookSmart:

Download or clone this repository

Open the file in Visual Studio Code and on the file BookSmartApplication.java right click and choose 'Run'

In your terminal window, go inside the created respository folder, then go inside the `client` folder.

`cd client`

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Go up a level:

`cd ..` 

Open the file in Visual Studio Code and on the file BookSmartApplication.java right click and choose 'Run'

Going back to the terminal:

Still inside the client folder, run the following command to install the dependencies:
